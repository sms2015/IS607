--Week 8 assignment

--You’re asked to design a small database that tracks blog posts, comments, and tags. You should:

--1.--
--Perform an Environmental Scan. Identify a favorite blog that has comments and tags enabled. Spend a 
--few minutes looking at the site, and think about how posts, comments, and tags are related. Deliverable: 
--URL of a favorite blog (or other type of site) that implements posts, comments, and tags.

--2.--
--Design the Logical Database. Determine what are the entitities (tables) and relationships between these 
--entities (1:1, 1:M, M:M?). Determine what are the most important attributes (columns) for each entity. It is 
--fine to make simplifying assumptions here—for example, we don’t need to track multiple authors, or 
--votes/ratings on posts. [Please feel free to implement any of these after you’ve got the core assignment 
--working]. Deliverable: an entity-relationship diagram (hand-drawn is acceptable).

--3. --
--Implement the Physical Database. Implement the database that you designed in step 1. Here, your 
--deliverable is the script that creates the tables.

--4.--
--Populate the Physical Database with Sample Data. Write INSERT statements that add a few rows to 
--each of the tables, so that the appropriate (one-to-one and one-to-many) relationships can be tested. 
--Deliverable: a single script with all of the insert statements.

--5. --
--Query the Data. Here, your deliverables are to write (1) a SQL query that returns all of the blog posts, with 
--associated comments and tags; (2) a SQL query that returns all of the posts for a given tag.
