--Thinking about the following instructions in the project:
--'Your long term task (which you are not going to do in this course, but you need to design for accordingly) 
--is to load all 16 months of data into a single database.'
--I added the date_time column to allow for data from each hour to be entered as a separate table
--It wasn't clear to me which date and hour the sample data was from so I just used CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to fill this field
--as an example
--If I were creating a table for each hour, I would name the file with the hour it came from instead of 'WikiData'

--This fills the new table with data from the sample file
COPY WikiData ( projectcode,pagename,pageviews,bytes )
