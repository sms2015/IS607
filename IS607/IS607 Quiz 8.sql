--(1)--
--Create a single table that includes information for the CEO, the SVP of IOS Software, and the SVP, Chief Financial Officer. 
--Also include information for the direct reports of the two SVPs. [You should have a single table with 8 rows].

--(2)--
--Write a query that displays all of the information in the table.


--(3)--
--Assume that (a) Tim Cook replaces Steve Jobs as CEO, and (b) Apple (hypothetically) hires Susan Wojcicki
--away from Google to replace Tim Cook at COO, with the COO reports unchanged.

--Your deliverable should include:
--The script to create the table,
--The INSERT statements to populate the table, and 
--The SQL query to pull information from the table, and
--The [INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE] SQL statements needed to update the information to reflect the new CEO and COO 
--as described in (3) above.
